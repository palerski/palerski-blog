### Rust Programming Language 101

**Rust** is a modern systems programming language that aims to provide memory safety and concurrency without sacrificing performance. It's designed to help developers build reliable and efficient software. Here's a brief introduction to Rust:

#### Key Features

1. **Memory Safety**: Rust guarantees memory safety by enforcing strict borrowing and ownership rules at compile time, preventing common errors like null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows.

2. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Rust provides high-level abstractions without any runtime cost, ensuring that the performance of your code remains optimal.

3. **Concurrency**: Rust makes it easier to write concurrent programs by providing safe concurrency primitives, reducing the chances of data races.

4. **Performance**: Rust is a compiled language, and its performance is comparable to languages like C and C++.

#### Syntax Basics

Here are some basic syntax elements in Rust:

- **Variables**:
  ```rust
  fn main() {
      let x = 5; // Immutable by default
      let mut y = 10; // Mutable
      println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);
  }
```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

fn main() {
    let result = add(3, 4);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}```
