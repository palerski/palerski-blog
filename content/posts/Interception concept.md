Intercepting communications signals, often referred to as signal interception or [[SIGINT]] (Signals Intelligence), involves capturing and analyzing electronic communications or signals.

- **Passive Interception:** Listening to signals without interfering with them. This is harder to detect.
- **Active Interception:** Involves transmitting signals (e.g., jamming or spoofing) to manipulate the target.
- **Frequency Monitoring:** Scanning the electromagnetic spectrum for specific signals of interest.
- **Traffic Analysis:** Examining metadata like source, destination, timing, and frequency without necessarily decrypting content.
