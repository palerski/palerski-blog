ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It's a character encoding standard used to represent text in computers and other devices that use text. Here's what you need to know:

What is ASCII?
Encoding System: ASCII assigns a numeric value to each character, including letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and control characters (like newline or tab).

Standard Characters: It includes 128 characters, each represented by a 7-bit binary number (0–127).

Key Characters
Control Characters (0–31): These are non-printable characters used to control devices (e.g., newline, carriage return, tab).

Printable Characters (32–126): These include common symbols, digits, and letters, such as:

32: Space

48–57: Digits 0-9

65–90: Uppercase letters A-Z

97–122: Lowercase letters a-z

33–47, 58–64, 91–96, 123–126: Various punctuation marks and symbols

Example
Here’s how the letter 'A' is represented:

Decimal: 65

Binary: 01000001

Hexadecimal: 41

Usage
Text Representation: ASCII is fundamental for text representation in computers and is the basis for other encoding systems.

File Formats: Many file formats use ASCII, especially those that are plain text (e.g., .txt files).

Here’s a quick look at some common ASCII characters and their codes:
Decimal	Character	Description
32	(space)	Space
65	A	Uppercase A
97	a	Lowercase a
48	0	Digit 0
49	1	Digit 1
33	!	Exclamation mark
46	.	Period (dot)
